# HTTP Traffic

## Description
```
Intercept HTTP request 🕸️ and observe response to get a flag. 🔑
```

Let's first open the activity and view the traffic created in the application using [HTTP Toolkit](https://httptoolkit.com). Once we do that, we can see a GET request being sent. In the response, we can retrieve the flag.
