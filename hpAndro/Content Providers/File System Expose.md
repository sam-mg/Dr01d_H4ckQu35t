# File System Expose

This is similar to the Webview task we completed in the [Damn Insecure and Vulnerable App](../../(Damn%20insecure%20and%20vulnerable%20App)/Task%20-%208.md) section. However, in this instance, we will be using the File System to expose data.

We need to access the file system and read a file from it. The input will be the file name, and the output will be the content of the file.

The input will look like this:
```
file:///data/data/hpandro.android.security/cache/hpAndro4009015532723428246.flag
```

The output is the flag:
```
hpandro{file.ufWRN2XcCkdM85PP9ySClt2mn29wzQ8g}
```
