# Flag One - Login

Letâ€™s explore the next vulnerability, found in the "Flag One - Login" activity.  
![](ScreenShots/Flag%20One%20-%20Login.jpg)

When examining the Java code of this activity, we see the following:
```java
public final void submitFlag(View view) {
    EditText editText = (EditText) findViewById(R.id.editText2);
    C1843g.m8724d(editText, "editText2");
    if (C1843g.m8721a(editText.getText().toString(), "F1ag_0n3")) {
        Intent intent = new Intent(this, (Class<?>) FlagOneSuccess.class);
        new FlagsOverview().m5595J(true);
        new ApplicationC0939j().m5616b(this, "flagOneButtonColor", true);
        startActivity(intent);
    }
}
```

Here, we can see that the required text ("F1ag_0n3") is hard-coded and not encrypted. This presents a significant security flaw. When the correct text is entered, the application navigates to `FlagOneSuccess.class`.

---
**Why is this happening?**  

The vulnerability exists because the application directly compares user input with a plaintext string. This approach is insecure as it exposes the password to potential attackers who can easily retrieve and exploit it.

**How is this happening?**  

The submitFlag method retrieves the input from the EditText field.
It then directly compares the input with a hardcoded plaintext string "F1ag_0n3" using C1843g.m8721a.
If the input matches the string, the application grants access to the FlagOneSuccess.class activity.

**How can it be prevented?**  

To prevent this type of vulnerability, consider the following best practices:

1. **Hash Passwords:** Use a cryptographic hash function to store and compare passwords securely.
2. **Use Secure Comparisons:** Ensure that password comparisons are done using constant-time algorithms to prevent timing attacks.
3. **Implement Proper Authentication Mechanisms:** Use established libraries and frameworks for authentication and avoid implementing custom authentication logic.

By following these practices, you can significantly enhance the security of your authentication mechanisms and protect against vulnerabilities like this.
