Lets now look into the third level thats where our Execurise starts.

Applications can be really large, so it is not possible to view every line of the code.
So in order to make our work easier, we have to set our checks.
1. Whats our goal?
We have to set our goal first like (Securing, CTF, or it can be anything)
Find something which is kind of feels wrong and try to exploit it.

2. API Calls
API Calls are one of the very important things which you have to work in an application.
Different apk will have different API calls, according to goal we have to look for API which are present in the file.

3. App Entry Points
You can enter the specific activity where we can enter and view it using adb commands.
This reduces a lot of time and make our work more easier.

4. Decryption Methods
The code you see has to be human-readable; if it is not then it is been encrypted or obfuscated.
You can find that by finding a methods where all the jumbled or binary arrays are sent, if so then it might be the deobfuscation method.

## Exercise #1 - Beginning RE with jadx
Lets now look at the First Exercise that is to get us familar with `jadx-gui`.
Identify where are the classes present and try to reverse it.

For our first level we can find that they are refering to `ThaiCamera.apk`.
You can get the files from the VM or also from [here](https://github.com/sam-mg/Dr01d_H4ckQu35t/tree/main/ragingrock/Files)

When we look at the website we can see that they have mentioned us about Excersise Content.
```bash
You are a malware analyst for Android applications. You are concerned that this sample maybe doing premium SMS fraud, meaning that it sends an SMS to a premium phone number without disclosure & user consent.
```
Here, we can see that we have to find a API which does SMS frauds, sending messages without user consent.
Firstly we have to know what is SMS Fraud.
1. What is SMS Fraud?
- Sending SMS Message from your phone without your consent. 
- Sending SMS to Premium Numbers without your consent.  

|  | SMS | Permimum SMS |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sender | General Purposes | Commercial Purposes |
| Cost | Usually Cheap | More Expensive |
| Sender | Personal Phones | Systems or Applications |

Now lets google what API are available for sending messages.
From refering [tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/android/android_sending_sms.htm) we can find that there are two ways like
1. API
    So we have to search for those API's in our `jadx-gui` and find those.

2. Built-In SMS Application
    In the other way we can find the permission in the `Android Manifest.xml` file.
