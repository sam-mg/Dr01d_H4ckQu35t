# Introduction

The [ThaiCamera.apk](./Files/ThaiCamera.apk) has been reported to send `Premium SMS` without user consent. To investigate this behavior, we need to reverse engineer the application and analyze its functionality.

Our first step is to examine the `AndroidManifest.xml` file using `jadx` to identify the permissions requested by the application. Notably, we find the following permission:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SEND_SMS"/>
```

This raises a significant concern, as it suggests the application might be sending SMS messages without explicit user approval.

Next, we utilize the `Search` feature in `jadx` to look for the keyword `Message` within the application. This search reveals the following classes associated with message-sending functionality:

```java
com.p001cp.camera.BootService
com.p001cp.camera.Loading
```

These classes are directly linked to the SMS-sending behavior and will be the focus of our reverse engineering efforts.
