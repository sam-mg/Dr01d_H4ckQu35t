In this section, we'll explore the essential concepts of Android application development. For a detailed overview, refer to the [Android Application Fundamentals](https://www.ragingrock.com/AndroidAppRE/app_fundamentals.html).

## Building an App
Understanding how to build an APK file is crucial, as it lays the foundation for reverse engineering applications.  
If you're unfamiliar with this process, don't worryâ€”we have a dedicated repository showcasing all the apps we've developed over time.  
You can find it here: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/sam-mg/JD-S4nd_B0x)

## Fundamentals Review
For a comprehensive guide to Android development, the official [Android Developer Guide](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/fundamentals) is an invaluable resource.  
This guide covers the core components and concepts of Android development, which will greatly enhance your understanding.

To examine the contents of an APK file, use the following command:
```shell
apktool -d <apk_file>
```
## Dalvik & Smali
Upon decompiling an APK, you'll encounter numerous `.smali` files.  
Smali is a human-readable representation of Dalvik bytecode.  
You can find the necessary decompiler and assembler tools on [Github](https://github.com/JesusFreke/smali/wiki)

## Application Entry Points
Identifying the entry points of an application, such as the Launcher activity, is essential.  
Applications with a user interface typically include the following structure:
```xml
<activity android:name=".LauncherActivity">
	<intent-filter>
    	<action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
    </intent-filter>
</activity>
```
A solid understanding of Intents, Broadcast Receivers, Services, Activities, and subclassing is highly beneficial for navigating and manipulating Android applications.
