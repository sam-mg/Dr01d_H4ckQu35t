This repository serves as a walkthrough for diving into Android Reversing. It features challenges crafted by various community members who, like us, share a passion for learning. The only difference? They started just a bit earlier than we did.

## These are the challenges that we will be covering:
1. [RagingRock](RagingRock)
2. [Damn Insecure and Vulnerable App (DIVA)](%28Damn%20insecure%20and%20vulnerable%20App%29)
3. [InjuredAndroid](InjuredAndroid)
4. [InsecureShop](InsecureShop)
5. [Frida Labs](Frida%20Labs)
6. [hpAndro](hpAndro)

In the respective directories you can find `mermaid` graphs. By following this sequence and delving into Android security blogs, you can build a solid foundation and excel in this field.

Happy learning!
