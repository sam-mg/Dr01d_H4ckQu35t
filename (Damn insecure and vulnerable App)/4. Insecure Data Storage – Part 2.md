# Insecure Data Storage â€“ Part 2

Let's jump into Task Four.  
Upon inspecting `MainActivity.class`, it leads us to `InsecureDataStorage2Activity.class`.

This activity reveals that data is stored in an SQL database named `myuser`. 
After entering details into the app, you can access and view this data in the database.

Here are the commands to access the database:
```bash
adb shell
cd data/data/jakhar.aseem.diva/databases/
sqlite3 ids2
sqlite> select * from myuser;
sqlite> .exit
```
Here's the terminal view of the database contents:

It's clear that the data we entered is stored in the database without any form of encryption.

Storing data in databases without encryption raises ethical concerns regarding data security and user privacy. Encrypting sensitive data before storing it in databases is essential to prevent unauthorized access and uphold ethical data handling practices.

By implementing encryption mechanisms, we can enhance the security of the application and protect user data from potential vulnerabilities.
