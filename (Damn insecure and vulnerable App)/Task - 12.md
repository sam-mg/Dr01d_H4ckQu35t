# Task - 12

We're now on Task Twelve.  
By exploring `MainActivity.class`, we find it navigates to `Hardcore2Activity.class`.

Here, we notice that the string to be checked is obtained from a `Jni` file.

Upon inspecting `DivaJni.class`, we observe that it accesses a file named `divaJni`. Our task is to locate and analyze this file.

| Pull Method | ApkTool |
| --- | --- |
| We can locate the file using the command `find / -name "*divajni*" 2>/dev/null` | Use `apktool d <apk_file>` to decompile the APK |
| Once located, pull the file using `adb pull <file_path>` | In the directories generated by apktool, look for `.so` files. |
| We then need to decompile the `.so` file. | Decompile it using IDA. |

Next, we proceed to IDAPro. Upon analyzing the file in IDA, we notice something interesting. Take a look:

Here, we see that it calls the `access` method, returning a string: `olsdfgad;lh`. When we cross-reference this with the source code of the activity, we see that this string is used for comparison. Let's try entering this string in the app.
