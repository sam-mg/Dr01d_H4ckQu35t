# Insecure Data Storage â€“ Part 1

Now, it's time for Task Three.  
Upon examining `MainActivity.class`, it directs us to `InsecureDataStorage1Activity.class`.

In this activity, it becomes apparent that entered data is stored insecurely in Shared Preferences. Once values are entered into the app's fields, they are saved directly into Shared Preferences.

To view these details, use the following commands:
```bash
adb shell
cd data/data/jakhar.aseem.diva/shared_prefs
cat jakhar.aseem.diva_preferences.xml
```
Here's a view from the terminal showing the stored details.

Clearly, the data we entered is stored in plain text within Shared Preferences.

Storing data in Shared Preferences without encryption is not recommended from an ethical standpoint. Encrypting sensitive data before storage is crucial to ensure data security and protect user privacy.

By implementing encryption practices, we can enhance the security posture of the application and adhere to ethical data handling principles.
