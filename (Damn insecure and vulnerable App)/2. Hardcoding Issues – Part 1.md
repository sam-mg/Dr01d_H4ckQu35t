# Hardcoding Issues â€“ Part 1

Let's proceed to Task Two.  
When analyzing `MainActivity.class`, it redirects us to `HardcoreActivity.class`.

Within `HardcoreActivity`, there's a critical validation step expecting the exact input `vendorsecretkey`.
```java
if (hckey.getText().toString().equals("vendorsecretkey")) {
    Toast.makeText(this, "Access granted! See you on the other side :)", 0).show();
} else {
    Toast.makeText(this, "Access denied! See you in hell :D", 0).show();
}
```
Successfully entering this key grants access to further permissions.

However, a crucial observation arises: the plaintext storage of sensitive data poses a security risk. To mitigate such vulnerabilities, it is strongly recommended to encrypt sensitive information before storage. This practice enhances security measures and prevents unauthorized access to critical resources.

By implementing encryption strategies, we fortify the application against potential exploits and uphold robust security standards.
