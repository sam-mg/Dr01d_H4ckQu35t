Here we go with Task Six.  
Reviewing `MainActivity.class`, it becomes clear that it points to `InsecureDataStorage4Activity.class`

While tackling this level, you might face some issues due to emulator permissions. Once you adjust these permissions, you can proceed to complete the levels.

When you navigate to the sdcard of your device, you'll notice a new file named `/.unifo.txt` being created, and the data is saved within it.

To view the file, use the following command:
```bash
adb shell
cd sdcard/
cat .uinfo.txt
```
This command allows us to view files starting with `uinfo`.

Here's a terminal view demonstrating this process:

It's evident that the password we entered is stored in a file without any encryption.

Storing sensitive data in files without encryption raises ethical concerns regarding data security and user privacy. Encrypting sensitive data before storing it in files is crucial to prevent unauthorized access and to uphold ethical data handling practices.

By implementing encryption protocols, we can significantly bolster the application's security and ensure the protection of user data against potential threats.
